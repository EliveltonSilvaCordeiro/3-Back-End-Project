This project is a solution for the challenge posted in <a href="https://www.101computing.net/weather-forecast-api/">101 Computing Net</a>, the details follow:


> **The aim of this challenge is to write a computer program to display a 5-day weather forecast for a specific location chosen by the end-user.**
>
>You program will:
>
> - Retrieve the city from the end user (input),
> - Use the Open Weather Map API to retrieve an up-to-date weather forecast for this city,
> - Parse the retrieved information,
> - Display the 5-day weather forecast for the selected location. (output)
>
>In order to do so you will use the Open Weather Map API: https://openweathermap.org/api
>
>You will need to sign in to get an API key.

I follow this challenge step by step in the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), and I also uploaded a regular Python version.


## :hammer: Functions

> In both files
> - Use your API key and type a name of a city to recieve a 5-day Weather Forecast for that city

> Only in the Python file
> - Program loop for searching many cities you want without having to run the code again 
> - Save the forecast in a text file
